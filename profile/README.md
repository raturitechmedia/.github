üëã I'm a python developer from New Tehri, India and I love to write about Python and build useful materials around it.
I have experience building web apps, rest APIs, scraping tools, also with data science libraries. I love to share and contribute as I myself have learned from open-source materials.

I run a free Newsletter "üêç [Python Ecosystem](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/python-ecosystem-6931092935862026241/)" on LinkedIn and a Blog at [raturi.in](https://raturi.in)

In this GitHub organization, I am creating libraries that other developers are using.

I am very passionate about these and want to do this full time and hire and train resources to make tools that can be free and at the same time are maintained just like any other paid tool.

One of the open-source tools I love is [List Monk](https://listmonk.app/) for email campaigns. It can save millions of dollars spent on sending emails via paid services.

My goal is to build similar kinds of tools for the world.

Thank you very much for your time.
